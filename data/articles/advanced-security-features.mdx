# Advanced Security Features in Zero Locker

Zero Locker goes beyond basic password management to provide enterprise-grade security features that protect your digital identity.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Our MFA implementation supports multiple authentication methods:

- **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)** - Compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, and other TOTP apps
- **Hardware Security Keys** - Support for FIDO2/WebAuthn compatible devices
- **SMS Backup** - Optional SMS-based backup codes

## Breach Monitoring

Stay informed about security breaches that might affect your accounts:

<Counter initialValue={0} step={5} />

The counter above represents how many breach notifications you might receive. With Zero Locker's breach monitoring, you'll be instantly notified if any of your accounts appear in known data breaches.

## Advanced Encryption

### AES-256-GCM Encryption

All data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM, which provides:

- **Confidentiality** - Your data cannot be read without the encryption key
- **Integrity** - Any tampering with your data will be detected
- **Authentication** - Ensures the data came from the expected source

### Key Derivation

We use PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations to derive encryption keys from your master password, making brute force attacks computationally infeasible.

## Zero-Knowledge Architecture

Zero Locker operates on a zero-knowledge principle:

- **We cannot see your passwords** - They're encrypted before leaving your device
- **We cannot recover your data** - Only you have the encryption keys
- **We cannot access your vault** - Even with a court order, we cannot provide your data

## Security Best Practices

Here are some tips to maximize your security:

1. **Use a strong master password** - At least 16 characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols
2. **Enable MFA** - Add an extra layer of security to your account
3. **Regular security audits** - Review your passwords and update weak ones
4. **Keep software updated** - Always use the latest version of Zero Locker

## Conclusion

Zero Locker's advanced security features provide the protection you need in an increasingly dangerous digital world. With military-grade encryption and zero-knowledge architecture, your data remains secure and private.
